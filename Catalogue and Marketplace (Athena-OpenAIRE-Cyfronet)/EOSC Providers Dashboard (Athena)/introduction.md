## Introduction

**EOSC Providers Dashboard**, as part of the EOSC Resource Catalogue is the Providers UI gateway to the EOSC Future ecosystem. It provides the UI functionality  to  register,  maintain,  administer  and  share resources  onboarded  by various providers.

The purpose of this document is to compile a set of basic instructions for configuring, building, installing, monitoring and maintaining a working instance of the EOSC Providers Dashboard as the UI front-end of EOSC Service Catalogue. It does not cover resource management operations: it provides thne necessary documentation for tech leads and integrators to set up the EOSC Providers Dashboard as a EOSC Core Component. Note that there are a lot of integrations with other EOSC Core Components: all these integrations are included in the documentation and in the Interoperability Guidelines referenced at the end of this document, in the References section.

### Intended audience

- Admins that are responsible for maintaining the EOSC Service Catalogue component
- Developers for building the software after code modifications
- Security admins for providing access to EOSC Service Catalogue proprietary features
- EOSC Core Component tech leads/integrators
- Anyone  else that  needs  to  configure, build, install and maintain an instance of the EOSC Service Catalogue software and services
