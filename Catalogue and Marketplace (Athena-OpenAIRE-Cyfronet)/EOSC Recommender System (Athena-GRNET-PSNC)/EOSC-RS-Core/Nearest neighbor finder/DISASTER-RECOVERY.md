## Disaster Recovery

In case of a distaster failure of all systems, data in PostgreSQL and HDFS should be restored from backups, and then the NN Finder applications can be redeployed or restarted.

Procedures for recovering from system failures can be found in [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and [Backup recovery](BACKUP-RECOVERY.md).
