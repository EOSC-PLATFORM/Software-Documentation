title Nearest Neighbor Finder search

participant "API\nOnline ML Engine" as online

participant "API\nNN Finder" as nn_finder

group Search for neighbors\nby IDs
online->nn_finder: 1. Get nearest neighbors\n- number of  neighbors,\n- context resources ID list 
note over nn_finder: Map IDs to internal index\nand then to object embeddings
note over nn_finder: Search by embeddings
note over nn_finder: Map results in internal index to IDs
nn_finder->online: 2. Nearest neighbors IDs \n(and optionally embeddings)
end
