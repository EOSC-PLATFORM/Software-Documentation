## Documentation and Training

The developers should keep the operational documentation up to date with the current state of the system. Update the [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) on every patch and keep in mind the files listed in [Index](../INDEX.md).

Training can be performed using the files in `docs` directory, with all of them linked in the [Index](../index.md). The [Introduction](introduction.md) provides a general overview of the system and links to more detailed documents. Other files important to see: [System Architecture](SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md), [Maintenance](MAINTENANCE.md), [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md), and [Security](SECURITY.md).

[References](REFERENCES.md) contain links to all documents not included in this repository that may prove helpful for further training.
