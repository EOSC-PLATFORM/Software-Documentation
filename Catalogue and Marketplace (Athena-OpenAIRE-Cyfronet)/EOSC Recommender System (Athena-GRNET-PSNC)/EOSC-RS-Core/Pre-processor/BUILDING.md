## How to build

The main application should be built using Dockerfile (e.g. via docker compose), see [developers guide](../DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md#how-to-run-using-docker-compose)

Building Spark jobs and uploading them to the cluster should be done using the scripts described in [operations](../operations/Operations.md).
