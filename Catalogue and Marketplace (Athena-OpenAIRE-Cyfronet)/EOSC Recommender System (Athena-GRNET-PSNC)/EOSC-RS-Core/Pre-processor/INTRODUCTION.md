## Introduction

The project repository covers the preprocessor service as well as jobs implementations for computation-intensive tasks
delegated to computing cluster.
The purpose of the Preprocessor is to pre-process data for other modules. The supported data concerns broadly understood 
resources from various sources, among others, users, sessions, recommendation evaluations, services, publications. 
In the case of dumps, the Preprocessor outsources the processing to the Apache Spark computing cluster.

For more information regarding OARG dumps see: [dumps](system-design/Dumps.md).
