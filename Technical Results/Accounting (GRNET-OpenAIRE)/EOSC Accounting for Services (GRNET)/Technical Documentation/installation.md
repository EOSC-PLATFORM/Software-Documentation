## Deploying Multiple Instances for High Availability

To ensure high availability of EOSC Accounting for Services, you can deploy multiple instances of the software and use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly among them. This setup helps distribute the load and provides redundancy in case one instance fails.
Follow these steps to deploy multiple instances of EOSC Accounting for Services with a load balancer:

### Set Up Multiple Instances

Install and configure multiple instances of EOSC Accounting for Services on separate servers or virtual machines. Make sure each instance is accessible over the network.

### Install and Configure Load Balancer

- Choose a suitable load balancer software or hardware appliance. For our setup, we use HAProxy.
- Install and configure the load balancer to distribute requests among the instances. Follow the specific documentation for the chosen load balancer.

### Update DNS or Networking

Adjust your DNS settings or network configuration to point to the load balancer's IP address or hostname. This way, all incoming requests will be directed to the load balancer.
