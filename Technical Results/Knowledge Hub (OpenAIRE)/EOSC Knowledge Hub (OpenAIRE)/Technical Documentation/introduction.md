##What is the EOSC Knowledge Hub

The Knowledge Hub is composed of two components, the Training Catalogue and the Learning Platform (learning management system (Moodle)).

The Training Catalogue component was developed within the development activities of the "EOSC Service Resource Catalogue", whose details are described in its own specific documenation.

The Learning Platform component is called OpenPlato and is hosted and operated by OpenAIRE AMKE on its premises and empowers the EOSC for the publication of the online training courses developed within the EOSC Future project.

OpenPlato is an instance of the open source software Moodle v4.1 ([https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_Workplace_4.1_release_notes](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_Workplace_4.1_release_notes)), and has not been deployed under the EOSC Future project, hence this documention will provide a generic description of the software and service features, and provide references to the open source repositories and available documentation for the deployment and installation of OpenPlato.
