## Security

- Security measures in place and best practices.

Storing data on servers should be accompanied by a high level of security. Access to this data should be restricted to authorized personnel, and developers should not have access to production data. Additionally, physical access to the server rooms should be impossible for external individuals, and a multi-step authentication process should be in place to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.


- How to manage access, authentication, and data protection.

We refer to the EOSC Search Service & Marketplace documentation where we describe more details about the security of the application.
