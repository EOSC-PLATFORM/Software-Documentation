## Introduction

The EOSC Research Product Catalogue is powered (hosted) by the OpenAIRE Graph, which is an open access scholarly knowledge graph (SKG) resulting from the aggregation of research entity metadata records (properties and links) from thousands of scholarly communication data sources (institutional, thematic, data, software repositories, publisher archives, scientific databases, funder databases, etc.). Funders, organizations, researchers, research communities and publishers can freely use the OpenAIRE Graph to monitor, discover, and navigate the open science record as a whole.

The OpenAIRE Graph is operated by the OpenAIRE AMKE on its premises and empowers the EOSC for the onboarding of research products and data sources. The software of the Graph has not been produced under the EOSC Future project, hence this documention will provide a generic description of the software and service features, and provide references to the open source repositories and avilable documetation for the deployment and installation of the Graph.
