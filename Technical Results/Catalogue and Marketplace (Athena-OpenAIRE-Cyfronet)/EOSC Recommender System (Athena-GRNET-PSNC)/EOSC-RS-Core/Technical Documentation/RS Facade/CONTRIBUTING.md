## About This File

This file was inspired by [contributing](https://contributing.md).

This file is useful to three groups of people.

- First, you, the person seeking contributions and therefore best placed to
 create and maintain the CONTRIBUTING.md. The file will help you outline how
  you expect others to contribute to the project.

- The next beneficiaries are contributors, people who are interested in knowing
 what items they are welcome to tackle and how they can navigate the project.

- The third group that the CONTRIBUTING.MD addresses are the project consumers.
 These are users who want to utilize the project offering to work on or build
 their projects.
