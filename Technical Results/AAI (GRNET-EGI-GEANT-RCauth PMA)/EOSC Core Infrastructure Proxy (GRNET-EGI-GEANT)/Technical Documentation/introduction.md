## Introduction

The EOSC Core Infrastructure Proxy is an Authentication & Authorisation Infrastricture (AAI) service that connects the EOSC Core and EOSC Support Services to the EOSC Federated AAI. Services that are eligible for connecting to the EOSC Core Infrastructure Proxy are:

- EOSC Core Services
- EOSC Support Services operated in the context of the EOSC-Future project
- EOSC Support Services operated by the EOSC Secretariat and/or the EOSC Association

The EOSC Core Infrastructure Proxy implements the [AARC Blueprint Architecture and interoperability guidelines](https://aarc-community.org/architecture/). Specifically it acts as an Infrastructure Proxy allowing users to use their institutional, social, ORCID, and community digital identities for accessing EOSC Core and EOSC Support services.
