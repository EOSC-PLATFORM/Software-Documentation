## Introduction

The EOSC EXPLORE portal is built with Angular, a popular open-source web application framework for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs). The current version of Angular in this application is version 16. 
Angular Server-Side Rendering (SSR), also known as Angular Universal, is used in this application, which allows rendering on the server, sending pre-rendered HTML to the client's browser.
