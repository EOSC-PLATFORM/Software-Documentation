## Introduction

The OpenAIRE UsageCounts is operated by the OpenAIRE AMKE on its premises and empowers the EOSC for the collection and aggregation of usage statistics of research products. The service is notified of views and downloads events intercepted at the data source web sites (e.g. search pages of repositories, aggregators) regarding research products. Events are tuples including the PID of the product, the type of the event, the data source identifier and a time-stamp (anonymous users) and are aggregated at the level of the PIDs and the data source ID in UsageCounts. The Service offers APIs to collect aggergated statistics for the purpose of discovery, selection, and reserch assessment. 

The UsageCount software has not been produced under the EOSC Future project, hence this documention will provide a generic description of the software and service features, and provide references to the open source repositories and avilable documentation for its deployment and installation.
