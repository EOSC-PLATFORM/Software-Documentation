### Important note

*Interoperability Registry is inherently connected with the Service Cataloge Infrastructure, sharing common resources, installation and deployment. Hence, same policies, instructions and procedures apply for both components.*

- Common maintenance issues are mostly related to interoperation issues to other EOSC Core components and their availability.
- Problems are diagnosed using health check probes, and are resolved using log information.
