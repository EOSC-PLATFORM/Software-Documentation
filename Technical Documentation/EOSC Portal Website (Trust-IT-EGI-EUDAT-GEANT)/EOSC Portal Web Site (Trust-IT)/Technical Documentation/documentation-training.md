## Documentation and Training

For Drupal 7 websites that rely solely on contributed modules and themes, creating extensive operational documentation might be overkill. Since these pre-built components come with their own documentation and support communities, troubleshooting issues often involves consulting existing resources or seeking help from the wider Drupal community. The focus then shifts towards understanding error messages, utilizing server logs, and identifying conflicts between modules or themes. This simplifies maintenance, as the legwork of documenting every aspect of the website falls on the shoulders of the original module/theme developers.
