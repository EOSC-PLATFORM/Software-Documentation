# Description

The following components are covered under this result,
1. The EOSC Training Catalogue is a catalogue of training resources pertinent to EOSC, and which consists of,
  a. a database,
  b. an advanced search interface and
  c. landing pages for training resources that have been aggregated or directly onboarded.
  d. The Training Catalogue also includes the metadata fields which on one hand are requested from providers to onboard resources,   and on the other hand provide end-users with the search capabilities,
  and in particular of those specific training resources that can address her/his training needs.
2. Learning and training resources created by the partners of the project.

|EOSC Ice Breakers (discussion cards) - EOSC Ice Breakers is a card game designed in the scope of the EOSC Future project as a training resource. It is intended for trainers providing training about the European Open Science Cloud to a wide range of stakeholders (researchers, service providers, policy-makers). |Iryna Kuchma, Milica Ševkušič |[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)|
|Science Project 2: Dashboard for the State of the Environment - Welcome to this module about the service “Dashboard for the State of the Environment”. This service was developed in one of the EOSC Future Science Projects, which aims at giving you insight into the state of the environment via an interactive dashboard. This module is intended for anyone (researchers, policymakers, general public) who would like to use the Dashboard, either to view and access the visualised data or to provide data to be shown on the Dashboard. For those who would like to duplicate the architecture to develop their own dashboard, a separate tutorial is being developed. |Angeliki K.Adamaki, Tjerk Krijger, Raul Bardaji, Margareta Hellström, Pascal Flohr|[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)|
|Sensitive Data for Social Sciences and Humanities - Welcome to this module which will introduce you to concepts of Sensitive Data, the different ways in which data is used in Social Science and Humanities subjects, what constitutes sensitive data in these subjects, and how to manage Sensitive Data in the context of Open Research Practices, and specifically the European Open Science Cloud. Content in this course is also applicable to other research disciplines and for a general understanding of the concepts that are presented. |Julia Geistberger, Lisa Hirsch, Elisabeth Königshofer|[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)|
|Open Research Practices in the Humanities and Social Sciences - Welcome to this module which will provide you with a general introduction to Open Research practices. You will find out how these are connected to FAIR data practices and access control to data. We recommend you complete this module before starting the module on Sensitive Data in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Open Research practices focus on collaboration and contribution of other researchers. The benefits of Open Research, and how EOSC facilitates Open Research are discussed. The concept of FAIR data is introduced and we show how sensitive data can still be shared in the research process under the assumption of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. |Julia Geistberger, Lisa Hirsch, Elisabeth Königshofer|[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)|
