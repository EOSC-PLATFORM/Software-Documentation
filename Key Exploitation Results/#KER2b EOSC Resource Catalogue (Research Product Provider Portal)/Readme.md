# Description
From: EOSC Core SP: EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace: Research Product Catalogue - EOSC SMS - Wiki EOSC Future 
The Research Product Catalogue is a component of the EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace and collects and interlinks metadata records about EOSC research products (including publications, data, and software) and EOSC services (from the Service Catalogue) with authors, communities, organisations, services, funders, and projects. The Research Product Catalogue supports resource onboarding via the EOSC Research Product Provider Dashboard of EOSC research product profiles. Such profiles are automatically collected (harvested) from EOSC data sources onboarded into the Service Catalogue and validated to verify their compliance with EOSC Research Product profile schemas and vocabularies. The Resource Catalogue enables discovery and navigation of EOSC resources and faceted views for statistics.
The catalogue is powered by the OpenAIRE Research Graph resulting from OpenAIRE-Advance.

|Deduplication of services and data sources -The software component for the duplicate identification and resolution within the  knowledge Graph was extended to support disambiguation of data sources and services via a machine and human-in-the-loop process. The results are visible from the EOSC marketplace, where data sources appear only once although their metadata is aggregated from several registries (EOSC Service Catalogue, OpenAIRE Graph, OpenDOAR, re3data.org, FAIRSharing.org). |CNR|[AGPL3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)|
|EOSC Tagging - The process of metadata deduction of the Graph was extended with a configuration to: 1. Support tagging of research products as relevant for EOSC, according to the following criteria: the product was collected from a datasource onboarded in EOSC and compliant to the OpenAIRE Guidelines v3, 4, CRIS, or OpenAIRE2.0 for data. The resulting tagged records are fed to the EOSC research product catalogue; 2. Support tagging of research products according to the EOSC Interoperability Framework |CNR|[AGPL3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)|
