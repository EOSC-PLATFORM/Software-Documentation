# Description

The Recommender System is a component of the EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace that helps the Researchers to find quickly and efficiently the relevant resources within a large set of EOSC diverse data. The recommendations, generated based on AI-enabled reasoning, use the metadata of EOSC Services and EOSC Research Products that can be discovered and utilised via the EOSC portal.
