# Description

Messaging a Publish/Subscribe Service, which implements the Google PubSub protocol. Instead of focusing on a single Messaging API specification for handling the logic of publishing/subscribing to the broker network, the API focuses on creating nodes of Publishers and Subscribers as a Service. It provides an HTTP API that enables Users/Systems to implement message oriented service using the Publish/Subscribe Model over plain HTTP.
