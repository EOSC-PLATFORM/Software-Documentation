# Description

The EOSC Service Provider Portal consists of the EOSC service catalogue and the EOSC service provider dashboard. EOSC Service Catalogue offers the underlying storage functionality and the interoperability tools for the programmatic access, registration, management (CRUD) of providers, services, and catalogues. It also offers the necessary API functionality for the interoperability of service catalogues from individual providers or aggregators (e.g. thematic, or regional catalogues) with the EOSC portal.
EOSC Service Provider Dashboard enables the front-end functionality for the registration of EOSC Providers, organisations entitled to publish their resources via the EOSC Catalogue, and offers them capabilities to onboard and manage EOSC resources. It also offers the Provider dashboard, where representatives from provider organizations have a detailed view on their offerings in the EOSC portal as well as various usage statistics on their resources. Finally, it offers to members of the onboarding team of the EOSC portal the functionality to manage the EOSC portal catalogue entries, i.e. manage the onboarding process of providers that apply to list their resources in the portal, audit on the onboarded resources, etc.
